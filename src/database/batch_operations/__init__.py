"""
Batch operations package - Modular batch processing classes.
Each operation type has its own specialized class for better maintainability.

Architecture:
- BatchProcessor: Main coordinator that delegates to specialized processors
- InsertProcessor: Handles INSERT operations with validation and retry logic
- UpdateProcessor: Handles UPDATE operations with key-based matching
- UpsertProcessor: Handles INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE and REPLACE operations
- DeleteProcessor: Handles DELETE operations with various criteria options
- BaseBatchProcessor: Common functionality shared by all processors
